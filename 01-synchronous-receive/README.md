# Exercise 01 - Synchronous receive

In this exercise you will be creating a synchronous `MessageConsumer` and `MessageProducer`

## TODO

* Create a `MessageProducer` in the `Sender` class and send a `TextMessage`
* Create a `MessageConsumer` in the `Receiver` class. The consumer must receive messages **synchronously** using the `receive` message.
* Add the received messages to the `messages` list.

## Testing

There is a `SynchronousReceiveTest` that you can run to test your application.
