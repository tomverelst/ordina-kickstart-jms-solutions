# Exercise 03 - Transacted messages

In this exercise you will be creating a transactional session and commit your messages.

## TODO

* Refactor the `Sender` and `Receiver` so the `Session`s created are transactional.
* Commit the messages after sending them.

## Testing

There is an `TransactedMessageTest` that you can run to test your application.
